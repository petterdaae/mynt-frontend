- Authentication is set up with auth0. I followed [this guide](https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-react-user-authentication/) when setting things up. To make authentication work locally, you should create (or obtain) an auth0 application and add a `.env.development.local` file with `REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` environment variables.
